# Javascript - Modules Package Managers and Bundlers

## Description

In this project I created a JavaScript Module that can be imported and used in any web page to change the cursor to pacman. Oh and there are ghosts following him, watch out for the green one, he is a derp (his movements are not as refined as the rest, but I just couldn't bring myself to change him).

There is a demonstration of the usage in a demo file bundled with Parcel.

It can be installed using npm: npm i pacman-cursor
